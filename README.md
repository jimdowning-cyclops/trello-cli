## Claude Code Skill System

This repo uses Claude Code's **skill** system. Skills are configuration files that give Claude Code specialized capabilities.

### What is a Skill?

A skill is a markdown file that defines how Claude Code should use specific tools or APIs. They are located in the `.claude/skills/` directory.

### Adding the Skill to Your Personal Directory

To use this skill everywhere on your system, copy it to your personal `.claude` directory:

```bash
# Copy the skill folder to your personal directory
cp -r .claude/skills/trello-cli ~/.claude/skills/
```

After this, Claude Code will automatically activate this skill whenever you mention "Trello" in any directory.
